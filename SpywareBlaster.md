# Introduction #
Microsoft allows ActiveX controls to be disabled via KillBits and regularly distributes some to keep InternetExplorer, Office, and other Microsoft programs using ActiveX safe from the very worst programs; additionally, SpyBot and [SpywareBlaster from BrightFort](http://www.brightfort.com/spywareblaster.html) allow for even more KillBits, to keep large quantities of adware and spyware from hooking into InternetExplorer (and with the subject of this wiki page, even Flash can be easily disabled in InternetExplorer).

# Recommendations #
Read the InternetExplorer article, including installation of that Privacy Choice list and immunization via SpyBot.

Install [SpywareBlaster](http://www.brightfort.com/spywareblaster.html) and place [this Custom Blocking List](http://koti.mbnet.fi/pattaya1/customblocking.txt) in its program directory; then immunize all of the InternetExplorer and FireFox entries, and go to the Tools menu and immunize all of the Custom Blocking entries (more ActiveX KillBits involved).

These immunizations are updated approximately once per month, but the vast majority of your protection will be conferred by doing this just once.

# Not Recommended #
Do not pay for a subscription: The immunizations aren't updated that often, and when they are it's not by much, so the occasional manual operation is sufficient.

Do not immunize the Restricted Sites: InternetExplorer runs a bit more slowly when the zones have many entries, and I already place all of the entries into a special HostsFile that protects all programs on your computer from those sites.
