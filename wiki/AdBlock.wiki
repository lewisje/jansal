= Adblock: Content-Filtering Extensions =
Ever since the early days of Mozilla Phoenix (which would be renamed Firebird and then FireFox), there has been [http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=3829 at least one extension] marketed as an ad-blocker, such as Adblock; at first they could only hide downloaded content via ElementHiding, but around 2006, Wladimir Palant, from Germany, released a new version of the Adblock Plus fork that actually kept content from being downloaded by monitoring HTTP requests and blocking those that matched a filter in a blocklist and no filters in a whitelist.

The idea behind Adblock Plus was used as well as practicable in some minor browsers, like Konqueror and QTWeb, and as GoogleChrome and AppleSafari developed their own extension systems, ad-blocking extensions came to be the most popular offerings, just as on FireFox; even InternetExplorer started to benefit, with Simple Adblock (which sadly became a paid extension and does suffer from FalsePositives), but Opera went its own way, with a UrlFilter list that must be modified manually (not programmatically via an extension) and can only be changed when the browser is closed or via its own "Block Content" interface (the SRWare Iron fork of GoogleChrome used a more limited idea called AdblockIni that cannot be updated at all while the browser is running; at first it was the only way to block content in any Chromium-based browser and is still the only reliable way to do so).

Although marketed to keep ads from annoying users, these extensions also allow for faster browsing with less cache usage (because content is not downloaded) and greater PassiveSecurity by blocking most vectors of malvertising (and if the right filter lists are chosen, some URLs primarily used for malware distribution); note that the extensions do not prevent people from navigating to URLs, they just block HTTP requests made within the page, like to retrieve images, scripts, and content for PlugIns, while the similar UrlFilter and AdblockIni also block navigation to URLs.

= Recommended Extensions =
== Firefox (1.5+) ==
[https://adblockplus.org/ Adblock Plus] is the original and best content-filtering implementation on any browser, capable of perfectly blocking content from being downloaded (even within plugins like Flash, so advertisements in videos can be blocked), with lists that can be automatically updated and include whitelists, ElementHiding, and a powerful and flexible syntax.

== Chrome (4+) ==
[https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb Adblock Plus for Google Chromeâ„¢] (formerly Adthwart from Tom Joseph of the United States) is now superior to Michael Gundlach's [http://chromeadblock.com/ Adblock for Chrome] because it blocks just as much yet runs faster and uses less memory; Gundlach's extension now registers the abp: pseudo-protocol just like Adblock Plus for FireFox does, and Palant's extension may soon do that.
An important limitation of Chrome itself is that extensions cannot modify plugin content, so most advertising inside Flash videos will still go through, but that isn't a serious security risk; notably YouTube ads can still be blocked, because they rely on Flash parameters within the HTML code, which can still be manipulated.

== Safari (5+) ==
[http://safariadblock.com/ Adblock for Safari] is based on Adblock for Chrome and written by the same author shortly after extension support was added; this extension actually blocks content perfectly because Safari does not suffer from [http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=35897 the subtle timing issue] that Chromium does.
There once were some cumbersome programs for the OS X version of AppleSafari, but they are no longer supported now that version 5 supports proper extensions; users of OS X Tiger and earlier (which do not support version 5) should search for sites that offer old software while they consider upgrading, possibly at substantial cost.

== Internet Explorer (6+) ==
[http://simple-adblock.com/ Simple Adblock], which comes with hard-coded subscriptions and a limited ability to add filters manually to a particular text file, was once recommended but now is only for those willing to deal with FalsePositives and pay $29.95; unlike InPrivate Filtering, this works on IE6 and IE7 too, and it also allows for ElementHiding.

== Opera (11.10+) ==
No suitable extension currently exists for Adblock Plus-style lists; the most popular OperaBrowser extension, Opera Adblock, instead uses subscriptions complying with the URL Filter API.

== SRWare Iron (3+) ==
[https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/chmimgmjdabgiilljdjfbonifbhiglao Adblock+ Element Hiding Helper], which uses only the ElementHiding rules and works in concert with AdblockIni, may clear some of the empty spaces left behind when content is blocked.

= Recommended Filter Lists =
== General/Privacy ==
[https://easylist.adblockplus.org/ EasyList] is the best overall ad-blocking list in existence, optimized for the filtering engine of Adblock Plus and similar extensions; it is probably offered as a default in your extension, and in Simple Adblock it is used exclusively. Be sure to add a regional list corresponding to the region you live in, but even if you commonly read pages from around the world, [http://adblockplus.org/en/getting_started#subscription don't add too many subscriptions] or you will [https://code.google.com/p/adblockforchrome/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#Do_you_recommend_to_subscribe_to_all_filter_lists? greatly bog down] whatever ad-blocking extension you use; in Simple Adblock a regional supplement will be downloaded based on what region you live in, and because I read a lot of sites based in Germany, I set my country to be Germany (Deutschland), even though I have always lived in the United States, just to get some additional filters.

The Privacy subscription may also be nice (I recommend using the [https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/easyprivacy+easylist.txt combined main and privacy subscription] instead of the two separate ones), but in Simple Adblock Beta on IE9 it leads to numerous false positives hiding much of the content of Google pages; also, the previously-recommended way to automatically make InPrivate Filtering lists relies on the version of the main list [https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/easylist_noelemhide.txt without its ElementHiding filters], because InPrivate Filtering does not use them.

== Direct Malware Filtering ==
[http://malwaredomains.lanik.us/malwaredomains_full.txt Malware Domains] is offered directly from the Adblock Plus [http://adblockplus.org/en/subscriptions subscription list page], and you may also consider the list offered by [http://www.malwarepatrol.com/cgi/submit?action=list_adblock Malware Patrol].

== Adult ==
Unfortunately, the maintainers of the previous list are wary of dealing with [https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://weis2010.econinfosec.org/papers/session2/weis2010_wondracek.pdf the intricate and aggressive measures] used by adult websites to deliver advertisements, so their policy is to leave those ads alone, even though they are among the worst offenders at delivering malvertising, because of the risk of FalsePositives is so high; that's why a New Zealander, [https://secure.fanboy.co.nz/ Fanboy], has made a supplemental [https://secure.fanboy.co.nz/fanboy-adult.txt Adult/Dating Blocking] list for this purpose, and in case Fanboy's site is taken down in another Denial of Service attack, you may switch to the less-broad [https://adversity.googlecode.com/hg/Adversity-Adult.txt Adversity Adult] supplement made by [http://adversity.uk.to/ Hubird], from the United Kingdom.
Either of those supplements, preferably [https://fanboy-adblock-list.googlecode.com/hg/fanboy-adblocklist-adult.txt the one from Fanboy], may profitably be used in the [http://simple-adblock.com/faq/personal-filters/ easylist_personal.txt] file in Simple Adblock, so that the dangerous adult ads may be blocked in InternetExplorer too.

Note that these lists merely block adult _advertisements_ and not adult websites; subscriptions likely exist, and filters can be created, to block most pornographic content, but the intention behind this whole project is to enhance security _without_ keeping you from doing what you want to do, even if that includes watching pornography.

== Chrome Workarounds ==
These should already be pre-selected in whichever extension you chose, but just in case, you can directly access the workarounds created by [http://chromeadblock.com/filters/adblock_custom.txt Michael Gundlach], [http://adthwart.qux.us/filters/recommended.txt Tom Joseph], and [https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/chrome_supplement.txt Wladimir Palant]; Joseph's workarounds are said to have been merged into the recommended general subscription, and Gundlach's list is recognized only by his own extensions, so you can copy it into the manual-filters section of his competitor, and for Adblock Plus on FireFox you can download that file, add the required line at the beginning, and just import it directly as a set of manual filters.

I'm not sure how well they actually work in FireFox or whether they are redundant or bog down performance; try it and see for yourself.

== Miscellaneous ==
The [http://rickrolldb.com/ricklist.txt Rickroll Blacklist] will never give you up, let you down, run around and desert you, make you cry, say goodbye, or tell a lie and hurt you, and it doesn't need a terrible yet catchy video to say it.

The [https://adversity.googlecode.com/hg/Antisocial.txt Adversity Antisocial] list is for those of us tired of nearly every site on the Internet asking us to Like them, Tweet their pages, Stumble Upon them, Digg them, or say we Reddit; I personally don't use this, because I happen to enjoy social-networking sites and unlike the other lists this one definitely breaks functionality, but it may make some sites run much faster and help stem any new [http://www.cgisecurity.com/csrf-faq.html XSRF] vulnerabilities found in social media.
Note that this list does not block the main pages of these sites, so Facebook, Twitter, and other services will continue to work; subscriptions likely exist, and filters can be created, to block most social-networking sites, but the intention behind this whole project is to enhance security _without_ keeping you from doing what you want to do, even if that includes social networking when you are supposed to be at work.

[http://pgl.yoyo.org/as/serverlist.php?hostformat=adblockplus&showintro=0&mimetype=plaintext Peter Lowe's AdServers] or [http://pgl.yoyo.org/as/serverlist.php?hostformat=adblock&showintro=0&mimetype=plaintext this version for the old AdBlock] may seem a bit redundant if you use the HostsFile version, but this one does block sub-domains of the listed domains.

= Not Recommended =
Basically, if I didn't list it, you shouldn't use it; in particular Fanboy's list is not optimized for the Adblock Plus engine and definitely should not be used in combination with the recommended list, although it is also maintained for OperaBrowser and SRWare Iron and forms the basis of my recommended filter lists for those browsers.
Also, I no longer recommend Simple Adblock for Internet Explorer; instead you should rely on an InPrivate Filtering list (IE8, Windows XP) or Tracking Protection List (IE9, Vista or later).
