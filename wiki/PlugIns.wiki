#summary Keep them updated: Most exploits use them rather than the browsers themselves.

= Definition =
Plugins are dynamic software libraries of compiled executable code that handle [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Internet_media_type Internet media types] (a.k.a. MIME types) not natively rendered by a Web browser and have all of its privileges; they are not part of the browser but instead are scanned from a set of known locations at launch and cannot be updated or removed while the browser is running, except in those browsers that permit the user to instantly disable plugins (like GoogleChrome).

Plugins are not the same as extensions, which alter the user interface (or chrome) of the browser or the manner in which content is rendered; a source of confusion is that some extensions are referred to by their authors as "plugins" and an extension can often install a plugin. A generic term popularized by FireFox for plugins, extensions, and themes (which merely change the background of the toolbars and window) is add-ons.
Most browsers with extension mechanisms (notably not InternetExplorer) automatically search for updates for your extensions and either update them for you (as GoogleChrome and AppleSafari do) or ask you to update and restart (as FireFox does).

You probably use plugins all of the time on the Web: Adobe Flash Player allows you to watch streaming video on sites like Youtube, Adobe Reader or another PDF plugin allows you to read documents on the Web, Java is required for some rich Internet applications (RIAs) to work (although increasingly Flash is preferred for applications not requiring direct filesystem access), Adobe Shockwave Player is used by some graphically rich Web games (some use Java and most use Flash), Microsoft Silverlight is a new major competitor to Flash and is now required for Windows Live Hotmail to function, and Quicktime, Windows Media Player, and Real Player are among the plugins used to render Web video, and before Flash became capable of streaming decent-quality video in 2005, re-encoding for Quicktime and Windows Media Player and maintaining separate pages for each video was the norm across the Web.
You may have plugins for other purposes, like using the DivX or Veoh Web Players, launching iTunes from the Web, or reading documents in the Microsoft Office, [http://www.documentfoundation.org/ OpenOffice.org], [http://www.alternatiff.com/ TIFF], or [http://www.caminova.jp/en/downloads/ DJVU] formats.

Because plugins have all of the privileges of the browser and work across browsers, a vulnerability in a plugin, especially a ubiquitous one like Flash, Java, or Adobe Reader, is even more profitable to exploit than a similarly-dangerous vulnerability in InternetExplorer or any other browser!
[http://krebsonsecurity.com/2010/05/revisiting-the-eleonore-exploit-kit/ Java is especially worrisome] because it has full filesystem access; ActiveX controls also have this problem, but they work only in InternetExplorer on Windows. ActiveX controls are used by InternetExplorer and other Microsoft products, including Office and Windows; in InternetExplorer, the plugins, extensions (BHOs), and even the Trident rendering engine itself are all ActiveX controls, while most browsers use NPAPI (Netscape Plugin Application Programming Interface) plugins and their own extension systems (InternetExplorer once also used NPAPI, and GoogleChrome still does even while bundling two extensions, Chrome PDF Viewer and a special build of Flash, that use a slightly different system). ActiveX-specific security shall be dealt with in the article on InternetExplorer.

= Recommendations =
Try to limit the number of plugins you have installed and disable the ones that you don't want; for example, if you have GoogleChrome and another non-IE browser, you will probably see the Google Update plugin registered in all browsers other than IE, but only GoogleChrome ever uses it. Also be on the lookout for old versions of plugins that may be lying around in non-standard locations; Flash was once notorious for this, and before Java 6 Update 10, new versions would not automatically uninstall older versions!

A good way on Windows to find updated versions of your plugins and remove so-called "zombie" installations is by using [http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scanning/personal Secunia PSI] (Personal software Inspector); this program also scans for outdated versions of other common programs and attempts to auto-update them for you, although some are concerned that PSI lacks the download verification found in Microsoft Update (which should also be on, to update Silverlight among other things).

There are also a couple of useful services for finding outdated plugins; [http://secbrowsing.appspot.com/ SecBrowsing] checks the most popular plugins and provides a convenient extension for GoogleChrome to alert you to outdated versions of those plugins, while [http://www.mozilla.com/plugincheck/ Mozilla Plugin Check] enumerates all plugins on browsers other than IE (checking for only the most popular plugins on IE, due to a technical limitation) and alerts you about outdated versions of the most popular (and most widely exploited) plugins, and in Firefox 3.6 it can be accessed easily from the Add-Ons dialog via the "Check for Updates" button in the Plugins menu.

Finally, in browsers other than InternetExplorer there is an easy way to keep plugins from auto-launching (in InternetExplorer the closest thing is manipulating the zones using [http://www.jasons-toolbox.com/programs.asp?Program=Trust%20Setter Trust Setter] but that is still clunky and insufficiently granular); they will be explained in the relevant browser articles but in essence, use NoScript in FireFox, the Allblocker Userscript in OperaBrowser, Plugin Customs in AppleSafari, and the click-to-play Labs feature in GoogleChrome, SRWareIron, and other Chromium-based browsers.
Keeping plugins from auto-launching will not only enhance your security, it will speed up your browsing experience by keeping undesired content from loading and running; a single click on a yellow, grey, or transparent rectangle is all you will need to do to watch that Youtube video or read that PDF.
