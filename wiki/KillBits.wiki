#summary Killbits keep ActiveX controls from being installed, or run if already installed.

= Killing Off Bad ActiveX Controls =
Along with its ActiveX technology in the late '90s, Microsoft introduced the concept of killbits, which keep misbehaving ActiveX controls from working anymore; eventually Microsoft started distributing its own, and so did independent entities like Patrick Michael Kolla (developer of SpyBot) and Javacool Software (maker of SpywareBlaster).

= Recommendations =
Follow the recommendations in the InternetExplorer article: Killbits apply to no other browser and no operating system except Windows.

= Not Recommended =
Unless you are sufficiently paranoid, do not disable ActiveX controls that users find useful, like Flash or Java; however, if you do want to disable Flash, SpywareBlaster offers an easy way to do so in its Tools menu.
