After the days of floppy-boot-sector viruses and before the age of malvertising, the most common means of malware propagation was through worms exploiting vulnerable applications listening on certain network ports, like 25 (SMTP, for e-mail) or 21 (FTP); until 2001, Windows did not even come with a firewall, it was not turned on by default until 2004, and even today it lacks outbound filtering (to keep bots from joining botnets or sending out spam).
